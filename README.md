# genomicSciencesCodes
In this repository you cand find all the programs in all languages I've made throughout my semesters in the Undergraduate program in Genomic Sciences. 
The languages you will find here are Python, C, R, Perl and maybe some bash codes. 
The documentantion of these codes will be in spanish due to the language used in my university's lectures, but I will try to translate them to english asap.
Feel free to send me an email asnking anything to angeldc@lcg.unam.mx
